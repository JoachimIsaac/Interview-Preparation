Problem 1 - Palindrome
Given a linked list, determine if it is a palindrome. Your method would take in a linked list and return True / False for whether the list is a palindrome or not.

Understand:
--> Does the nodes in the linked list contain only characters.

--> Can we use other data structures (extra space)

--> Can we get an empty linkedlist?(yes)==> return "Not valid!!"

--> If it only has one node we return true 

--> is it a doubly or singlely linkedlist 

--> Do we return in place? (yes)

def isPalindrome(linkedlist):
  #return True or False  
  pass

"a" return True 
a -->b-->a ==> True 


"a-> b -> a -> a ->b" return False


Plan:
1. go through linked list and put the chracters in an array. 

start = 0 
end = len(arr) - 1 
[a,b,a]

while start < end:
  if arr[start] == arr[end]:
    start += 1
    end -= 1
  else:
    return False 

return True

current position is right to the left of middle
if(current == current->next->next):
  delete current and current->next->next from linkedlist
  update pointers
elif (current->next == null):
  return true

Problem 2 - Detect Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. For this problem, it may be helpful for you to write some pseudocode on how to build a linked list with a cycle. A linked list with a cycle may look something like:


1 ---> 2 ---> 3 ---> 4
        \           /
          \       / 
            \    / 
              \/

--> Can we use more space? 
--> is it a doubly or singlely linkedlist 
--> What do we return to say that it has a cycle?==> True or format

--> Circular linked list should be considered to have a cycle
--> If a node points back to itself, is that a cycle? (Yes)
--> Should this be done on a single pass?

def containsCycle(linkedlist):
  #return True or False 
  pass

input: 1 ---> 2---> 3 
                    | \ 
                    | /
                    |/
output: 
Return True
input:
1 ---> 2 ---> 3 ---> 4
        \           /
          \       / 
            \    / 
              \/
output: True

Problem 3 - Remove Instances

Given a linked list and a value x, remove all instances of x from the linked list.

-->Can we use a hashset?
-->Can we do it in one pass?
-->singly or doubly?
--> Should we be returning in place?
--> What happens if we need to remove all nodes? (Head --> None)

--> 

1--> 2 -->1 -->2-->3.  ==> 3->

  #return linkedList

##############################################
Problem 4 (Challenge!) - Partition
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

If your group finishes early, try to go through the next UMPIRE steps (Match, and Plan) for the listed problems. While thinking through how you might approach a problem, you might discover that there are other clarifying questions you needed to ask!

x = 10 

output should meet these requirements:
==>  nodes < x come before nodes >= x 

input: 1-->2-->3-->10-->11-->12-->9 


possible output:
      # 1-->2--> 3-->9-->12-->10-->11
       # 1-->2-->3-->9-->10-->11-->12
       # 1-->2-->3-->9-->11-->10-->12

Understand: 
--> Can we do it in multiple passes?
--> Can we use extra space?
--> Do we need to return in place?
--> Singly or doubly?
--> what happens if we get an empty list ? ==> return None 
--> preference for ordered or unordered?

For each problem, the goal for the group is to:

Verbally discuss 2-3 ways to solve the problem and discuss tradeoffs with each approach

Think about whether there are any 'magical' helper methods that would greatly help you solve the problem

Walk through 2 example inputs and explain how the solution would produce the desired output


Problem 1 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

Examples:

Input: 1->1->2  
Output: 1->2  

Input: 1->1->2->3->3  
Output: 1->2->3 

Input: 1->1->1->1->2->3->3  
Output: 1->2->3 

Input: 1->1->1->1->1->1->1
Output: 1

ways to appreach:
1. Two pointers => trade offs O(N) time
1. hash table =>  O(N) time and O(N) space 


magical method ==> remove()

Problem 2 - Linked List Cycle
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. For simplicity, assume the linked list cannot have more than 1000 nodes in it.

   ^-----'

This linked list would return False
1 -> 0

1. Two pointers(Fast and slow) => trade offs

1. hash table =>  O(N) time and O(N) space
